# Ex5 Stack Operations
## DATE:27/02/2025
## AIM:
To write a C function to perform push and pop operation of the stack in the infix to postfix conversion.

## Algorithm

1. Start the program.  
2. Initialize a stack and set the top index to -1.  
3. Define the `push()` function to insert an element into the stack. 
4. Define the `pop()` function to remove an element from the stack.  
5. Check for stack overflow before pushing an element.
6. Check for stack underflow before popping an element.  
7. Display the stack elements when required.  
8. End.

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression
Developed by: PRADEEP E
RegisterNumber:  212223230149
*/
```
```
#include<stdio.h>

char stack[100];
int top = -1;

void push(char x)
{
   stack[++top]= x;
}

char pop()
{
   if(top == -1)
        return -1;
    else
        return stack[top--];
}
```

## Result:
Thus the C program to perform push and pop operation of the stack in the infix to postfix conversion is implemented successfully.
